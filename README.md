Environment Vars:<br>
  CHECK_ALL: "Y" or "N": Default "N"<br>
    Toggles between checking entire directory or recently added files (3 days ago). Auto flips to "N" after a full run.<br>
  ENCODE: "Y" or "N": Default "N"<br>
    Toggles between enabling reincoding. If bitrate of file is >75Mbps the program will attempt to reincode the file such that it's easier for hardware limited decoders to process while still
    retaining as much quality as possible. **Warning** if enabled, reencoding will dramatically increase the conversion time of a file. TODO: Add support for nvidia devices.<br>
